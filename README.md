## Ecological Remote Sensing with `R` and `Google Earth Engine`
*Thiago Sanna Freire Silva - Department of Geography - SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro .* 

Welcome to the source page for our one-day workshop on Ecological Remote Sensing! This repository will contain all course material. 

To get set up for the course, please follow the steps below:

#### 1) Register for a Google Earth Engine account:

- Go to https://earthengine.google.com/signup/

- Sign-up with a Google account. I'm not sure what the waiting time is at the moment, so I suggest you do it **ASAP**.

- You will need a Google Drive associated with your login, to export data.

- Feel free to browse through the [GEE Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorial_js_01) if you wish. I suggest checking at least the basic [JavaScript Intro](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorial_js_01). Especially if you're used to another programming language, JS can be a bit mind boggling (at least it is for me!). The [Mozilla JS tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is good too, if you need a more complete tutorial. 

  

#### 2) Make sure you have the latest version of R (3.5) and RStudio

This course assumes basic familiarity with the `R` programming language (reading data in, manipulating data, working with `data.frames`, plotting), and with programming concepts in general (variables, functions, loops) .



#### 3) Install the `R` packages `raster`,`rgdal`,`sp`,`caret`,`ggplot2`

That's it, you're good to go!
