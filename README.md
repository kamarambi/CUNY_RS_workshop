Welcome to the source page for our one-day workshop on Ecological Remote Sensing! This repository will contain all course material. 

To get set up for the course, please follow the steps below:

#### 1) Register for a Google Earth Engine account:

- Go to https://earthengine.google.com/signup/

- Sign-up with a Google account. I'm not sure what the waiting time is at the moment, so I suggest you do it **ASAP**.

  

#### 2) Make sure you have the latest version of R (3.5) and RStudio

This course assumes basic familiarity with the `R` programming language (reading data in, manipulating data, working with `data.frames`, basic use of functions for analysis and plotting). 



#### 3) Install the `R` packages `raster`,`rgdal`,`sp`,`caret`,`ggplot2`

That's it, you're good to go!
